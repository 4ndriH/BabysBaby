My first Discord Bot!

Just adding any CMDs that come into my head and atm is only meant for one specific server.

If you actually want to look at my Code:

The command structure is stolen from Pherb (Thx btw (he has stolen it too from somewhere but added some stuff afaik)) and with that for every CMD there is an own file.
The commands are split into Owner, Admin and Public CMDs. They each have an own folder under "BabysBaby/Baby/src/main/java/BabyBaby/Command/commands/".
